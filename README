PREREQUISITIES

At this point, ulppk2 must be properly 
installed. Just having the development
tree isn't good enough ... the libraries
must be installed by using:

sudo make install


Future versions will provide more
sophisticated configuration so we can
compile the demos from the development
source tree. 

BUILDING FOR INSTALLATION w/o debugging

./configure
make
sudo make install

BUILDING FOR DEBUGGING

config4debug is a shell script that wraps the configure script.
It sets CFLAGS to enable gdb debugging and turn off optimization.
(gdb gets weird when optimization is enabled.) If the argument "logging"
is provided, the config4debug script also sets the define 
ULPPK_DEBUG so that additional diagnostics are printed. 

runconfigure.sh is deprecated. 

To enable gdb debugging

./config4debug 
make 
sudo make install 

To enable gdb debugging and logging

./config4debug logging
make 
sudo make install 



DEBUGGING

cd into the src directory and use libtool to run the debugger.
For example, to debug the demo server:

cd src
libtool --mode=execute gdb demoserver


SYSLOG setup

On Ubuntu-like systems using rsyslog, system logging setups for the demo
server can be set up simply by copying doc/ulppkdemo.conf to
/etc/rsyslog.d and restarting rsyslog

cp ulppkdemo.conf /etc/rsyslog.d
service rsyslog restart

Other configurations/system logger configurations will have to
handled differently. In this case, the contents of doc/ulppkdemo.conf 
provide a usable example. 

DATA DIRECTORIES

Installation of ulppk2-demo will create directories under
/var/ulppk2-demo for the storage of various files. It will also
copy the settings files to /usr/local/etc

Note that these data directories must either be created by hand
or by the make install target. In either case, root privilege
will be required to create the directories.

INSTALLATION

sudo make install

Note: This will create the data directories mentioned above.
